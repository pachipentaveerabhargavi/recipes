        <h3>Preparing the Rice Flour Sheets:</h3>
        <ul>
           <li>Prepare a thin rice flour batter by mixing rice flour with water. The consistency should be similar to that of dosa batter.</li>
           <li>Heat a non-stick pan and grease it lightly with ghee.</li>
           <li>Pour a ladleful of the rice flour batter and quickly spread it into a thin sheet using circular motions. Cook until it forms a thin, translucent sheet.</li>
           <li>Remove the sheet carefully and let it cool.</li>
           <li>Repeat this process to make more rice flour sheets. You’ll need around 15-20 sheets.</li>

        </ul>
        <h3> Preparing the Pootharekulu:</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Take one rice flour sheet and apply a thin layer of ghee over it.</li>
            <li>Sprinkle powdered sugar, cashews, almonds, and cardamom powder evenly over the sheet.</li>
            <li>Carefully roll the sheet from one end to form a cylindrical shape.</li>
            <li>Repeat this process for all the sheets.</li>
            <li>Once done, trim the edges of the rolls</li>
            <li>Garnish the rolls with edible silver leaves (varak), if using.</li>
        </ul>
